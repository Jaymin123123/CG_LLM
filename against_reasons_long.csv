Airtel Africa Plc,Approve Remuneration Report,Against,"We were concerned that there was no disclosure of performance targets which determine vesting of the Long Term Incentive Plan. We were concerned regarding the pay for performance alignment. Concerns have been identified with the departing CEO's exit arrangements, in particular the Company's decision to pro-rate his outstanding LTIP awards until after his retirement date and following a further 12 month period during which time he will provide advisory services to the Company. Furthermore, the Company has chosen to accelerate vesting of these awards to 30 June 2024 and estimate the performance for the ensuing year in determining the amount that should vest. Lastly, he is not subject to the post-vesting holding period for the LTIP awards. The incoming CEO received a one-off exceptional award to incentivise a strategic initiative.",Aberdeen Asset Managers Ltd.Standard Life,AGAINST

Schroders Plc,Approve Remuneration Report,Against,"We have been unsupportive of the company's Remuneration Policy, and consequently its Remuneration Report, in recent years. Our concerns relate to the absence of a specific cap on the annual bonus scheme. While in 2020 the company introduced an overall cap on total remuneration at time of grant for the CEO (9m sterling pounds) and CFO (4.5m sterling pounds), the bonus does not have an underlying limit which we expect to see. There is a limit on the Long-Term Incentive, of 4x salary, however awards in practice have been far lower - at 1.2x and 1x. Therefore the bonus potential, taking account of the total remuneration cap, is significant when considering the executive salary and LTI grant level. We do note that executives have not received salary increases, the bonus outcome was reduced by 250k sterling pounds to reflect shareholder experience and there was no LTI vesting in FY23 due to the waiving of awards during the pandemic in 2020. However in view of our ongoing reservations regarding the absence of an individual cap on the annual bonus, we have voted against.",Aberdeen Asset Managers Ltd.Standard Life,AGAINST

Also, the CEO's bonus opportunity is very high (the same as the LTIP opportunity) at 400% of salary. However, we have exceptionally supported as we are mindful that salaries continue to be positioned at lower quartile (using a balanced comparison) and as variable awards are based off of salaries, the outcomes are not as problematic as they first appear.

BAE Systems Plc,Directors' Remuneration Report,For,"Under normal circumstances, we would not be able to support this resolution, as we have concerns on the lack of performance targets in the cash flow and ROCE elements of awards granted under its LTIP. These targets are commercially sensitive and, as such, they will be disclosed retrospectively post vesting, mitigating our concerns. Restricted share awards granted to US executives are not subject to performance and time-vest based solely on continued employment. The board'states this award package ensures competitiveness with US market practice, and that such awards are not granted to UK-based executives. Such awards to US executives are limited to 150% of base salary, and the majority of their equity-award package is subject to performance. The CEO:Employee pay ratio is more than 191:1 and is considered excessive. The pay ratio has been impacted by the increase in the CEO's remuneration for 2023, primarily as a result of share price appreciation on the 2021 Performance Share award between the grant and vesting dates. We note UK employees received a c.6% pay increase in 2023 and will receive increases in 2024 averaging 4.5% for executives and 5.2% for employees. The LTIP meeting threshold performance conditions will result in vesting of 25% of the award potential, and this level of vesting represents approx. 92.5% of salary. We consider this to be excessive. Given the mitigating factors cited above, we are exceptionally voting in favour on this occasion.",Aviva Investors Global Services Ltd.,FOR

Given the circumstances of the former CEO's departure, Bernard Looney's pay will be under the spotlight but in our view It's not likely to receive much shareholder opposition, because (as announced by the Company on 13 Dec 2023) he was not be paid a bonus for 2023 and will not be entitled to unvested performance share awards or deferred bonuses.

Legal & General Group Plc,Approve Remuneration Report,For,"Under normal circumstances, we would have voted against the remuneration report to reflect that the new CEO has been appointed on a higher salary and has more variable pay opportunity than his predecessor. Typically we would expect new executives to prove themselves in the role first before getting paid more. However, we have exceptionally supported as we are mindful that the total pay opportunity for the previous CEO was quite conservative, a point which the company alludes to. The company also explains that, in acknowledgment of the fact that his pay would be higher than Nigel Wilson's, the Committee'sought to deliver the majority of the increase through variable pay rather than fixed pay, to ensure that a material portion of pay was linked to performance. This allowed the Committee to moderate the level of fixed pay required to secure Mr Simoes' appointment. Finally our view is that the new CEO has a good pedigree and has been impressive to date. Nevertheless the company is aware that we will be closely watching any salary increase and bonus outcomes closely next year.",Aviva Investors Global Services Ltd.,FOR

We are exceptionally supporting on this occasion due to financial performance over the period and our concerns on the LTIP and ROIC vesting will be mitigated in 2024 with the adoption of the remuneration policy.

Concerns also remain with the structure of the LTIP in that 22.5% of the award vests for the achievement of threshold performance targets (i.e median TSR performance) which we think is too generous given awards this level of vesting represents approximately 90.00% of salary. Further, if approved under resolution 2, award levels will increase from 400% to 500% of salary for both Executive Directors'compounding our concerns over the amount of salary in shares vesting for threshold performance. However, we have exceptionally supported on this occasion as the increased CEO pay ratio is primarily due to the vesting of the CEO's first full LTIP award from 2019 which vested at 94.1% at the end of the 2023 performance year. Regarding our concerns over the LTIP, the Committee has stated that the proposed cap of at 500% of salary would position award levels closer to FTSE 10 peers where the median LTIP maximum award is in excess of 500% of salary, yet still materially below US pay levels.

We are mindful the CEO's salary will be increased by 4% to 829,000 sterling pounds from 1 April 2024, in line with the average increase for the wider UK workforce. Further, the CFO'stepped down from the Board on 30 November 2023 and his unvested RSAs lapsed. His successor was appointed on 1 March on a salary broadly at the same level.

Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc,Approve Remuneration Report,Against,"High Payout Ratio Despite Reduced Profits: Despite a decline in profits this year, total short-term remuneration remains above 150% of base salary, and total variable compensation exceeds 350% of base salary. This high payout ratio raises serious concerns about whether executive pay aligns with company performance. * Lack of Product Safety Consideration: The current variable pay structure fails to consider product quality and safety. This is especially concerning in light of the recent high-profile lawsuit against the company's Enfamil infant formula, linked to a tragic infant death. We advocate for a dedicated ESG metric directly linked to product safety mechanisms, such as product recall rates, product liability claims, or safety incidents. These factors should directly impact executive compensation. * Incomplete ESG Metrics with Scope 3 Emissions Gap: The current ESG metrics, which only account for 10% of long-term incentive conditions, focus solely on Scopes 1 and 2 of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This approach neglects Scope 3, the largest contributor to the company's overall footprint. While we acknowledge the commitment to reduce Scope 3 emissions and its inclusion in the ""Sustainable Innovation Calculator"" metric, we believe a dedicated incentive focused solely on Scope 3 reduction is necessary. The current link between Scope 3 progress and executive compensation remains unclear, potentially allowing for diluted reduction efforts. Recommendations for improvement: We urged the consumer goods company to revise the compensation structure to better reflect company performance and prioritise product safety. This could involve tying a higher proportion of variable pay to achieving specific performance goals, including those related to product safety. Implement a dedicated ESG metric explicitly linked to Scope 3 GHG emission reduction progress, with a clear and transparent link to payout levels.",Candriam Investors Group,AGAINST

Pearson Plc,Approve Remuneration Report,Against,"A vote AGAINST this item is considered warranted because:- The Company's remuneration policy received significant dissent at the 2023 AGM (46% against) in light of concerns around the substantial increase in both the annual bonus and LTIP maximum opportunities. Despite the level of dissent recorded, no material actions have been taken to the remuneration arrangements to address the concerns.- Concerns remain on the subjective nature of the Co-Investment Award's performance underpins and their sufficiency and appropriateness to justify the substantial payout. It is, however, recognised that the Remuneration Committee has provided commentary in the annual report on its assessment of the performance underpins.

Pearson Plc,Approve Remuneration Report,Against,"A vote AGAINST this item is considered warranted because: The Company's remuneration policy received significant dissent at the 2023 AGM (46% against) in light of concerns around the substantial increase in both the annual bonus and LTIP maximum opportunities. Despite the level of dissent recorded, no material actions have been taken to the remuneration arrangements to address the concerns. Concerns remain on the subjective nature of the Co-Investment Award's performance underpins and their sufficiency and appropriateness to justify the substantial payout. It is, however, recognised that the Remuneration Committee has provided commentary in the annual report on its assessment of the performance underpins.

Pearson Plc,Approve Remuneration Report,Against,"The Company's remuneration policy received significant dissent at the 2023 AGM (46% against) in light of concerns around the substantial increase in both the annual bonus and LTIP maximum opportunities. Despite the level of dissent recorded, no material actions have been taken to the remuneration arrangements to address the concerns. - Concerns remain on the subjective nature of the Co-Investment Award's performance underpins and their sufficiency and appropriateness to justify the substantial payout. It is, however, recognised that the Remuneration Committee has provided commentary in the annual report on its assessment of the performance underpins. This scheme was previously supported by majority of shareholders, albeit not without notable dissents",Pictet Asset Management SA,AGAINST

Pearson Plc,Approve Remuneration Report,Against,"A vote AGAINST this item is considered warranted because: The Company's remuneration policy received significant dissent at the 2023 AGM (46% against) in light of concerns around the substantial increase in both the annual bonus and LTIP maximum opportunities. Despite the level of dissent recorded, no material actions have been taken to the remuneration arrangements to address the concerns. Concerns remain on the subjective nature of the Co-Investment Award's performance underpins and their sufficiency and appropriateness to justify the substantial payout. It is, however, recognised that the Remuneration Committee has provided commentary in the annual report on its assessment of the performance underpins. This scheme was previously supported by majority of shareholders, albeit not without notable dissents.",Storebrand Asset Management AS,AGAINST

Our concerns relate to the absence of a specific cap on the annual bonus scheme. While in 2020 the company introduced an overall cap on total remuneration at time of grant for the CEO (£9m) and CFO (£4.5m), the bonus does not have an underlying limit which we expect to see. There is a limit on the Long-Term Incentive, of 4x salary, however awards in practice have been far lower – at 1.2x and 1x. Therefore the bonus potential, taking account of the total remuneration cap, is significant when considering the executive salary and LTI grant level. We do note that executives have not received salary increases, the bonus outcome was reduced by £250k to reflect shareholder experience and there was no LTI vesting in FY23 due to the waiving of awards during the pandemic in 2020. However in view of our ongoing reservations regarding the absence of an individual cap on the annual bonus, we have voted against.",Aberdeen Asset Managers Ltd.Standard Life.1,AGAINST
