The achievement of threshold performance conditions (only) results in vesting of 20% (in respect of the absolute TSR target) and 25% of the award potential (in respect of median relative TSR), and this level of vesting represents 90% of salary which we consider to be overly generous for this level of performance. Also, the CEO's bonus opportunity is very high (the same as the LTIP opportunity) at 400% of salary. However, we have exceptionally supported as we are mindful that salaries continue to be positioned at lower quartile (using a balanced comparison) and as variable awards are based off of salaries, the outcomes are not as problematic as they first appear.

These targets are commercially sensitive and, as such, they will be disclosed retrospectively post vesting, mitigating our concerns. Restricted share awards granted to US executives are not subject to performance and time-vest based solely on continued employment. The board'states this award package ensures competitiveness with US market practice, and that such awards are not granted to UK-based executives. Such awards to US executives are limited to 150% of base salary, and the majority of their equity-award package is subject to performance. The CEO:Employee pay ratio is more than 191:1 and is considered excessive. The pay ratio has been impacted by the increase in the CEO's remuneration for 2023, primarily as a result of share price appreciation on the 2021 Performance Share award between the grant and vesting dates. We note UK employees received a c.6% pay increase in 2023 and will receive increases in 2024 averaging 4.5% for executives and 5.2% for employees. The LTIP meeting threshold performance conditions will result in vesting of 25% of the award potential, and this level of vesting represents approx. 92.5% of salary. We consider this to be excessive.

Given the circumstances of the former CEO's departure, Bernard Looney's pay will be under the spotlight but in our view It's not likely to receive much shareholder opposition, because (as announced by the Company on 13 Dec 2023) he was not be paid a bonus for 2023 and will not be entitled to unvested performance share awards or deferred bonuses. We welcome that clawback has been applied.

Also, there continue to be no ESG metrics incorporated into remuneration plans. However, this is not a vote against as no concerns have been identified with regards to executive pay nor its ratio with median employee pay and we acknowledge the strong performance of the Company for the year under review which resulted in an increase in the CEO's single figure, primarily driven by the value of the LTI. Further, we note certain principal ESG-related business risks and the Company has separately set quantitative targets to support sustainable business strategy (improving financial health, diversity and environment). The company has notably set environmental goals that focus on carbon footprint reduction, and have had'SBT'-approved targets as well.

Typically we would expect new executives to prove themselves in the role first before getting paid more. However, we have exceptionally supported as we are mindful that the total pay opportunity for the previous CEO was quite conservative, a point which the company alludes to. The company also explains that, in acknowledgment of the fact that his pay would be higher than Nigel Wilson's, the Committee'sought to deliver the majority of the increase through variable pay rather than fixed pay, to ensure that a material portion of pay was linked to performance. This allowed the Committee to moderate the level of fixed pay required to secure Mr Simoes' appointment. Finally our view is that the new CEO has a good pedigree and has been impressive to date.

This high payout ratio raises serious concerns about whether executive pay aligns with company performance. * Lack of Product Safety Consideration: The current variable pay structure fails to consider product quality and safety. This is especially concerning in light of the recent high-profile lawsuit against the company's Enfamil infant formula, linked to a tragic infant death. We advocate for a dedicated ESG metric directly linked to product safety mechanisms, such as product recall rates, product liability claims, or safety incidents. These factors should directly impact executive compensation. * Incomplete ESG Metrics with Scope 3 Emissions Gap: The current ESG metrics, which only account for 10% of long-term incentive conditions, focus solely on Scopes 1 and 2 of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This approach neglects Scope 3, the largest contributor to the company's overall footprint. While we acknowledge the commitment to reduce Scope 3 emissions and its inclusion in the ""Sustainable Innovation Calculator"" metric, we believe a dedicated incentive focused solely on Scope 3 reduction is necessary. The current link between Scope 3 progress and executive compensation remains unclear, potentially allowing for diluted reduction efforts. Recommendations for improvement: We urged the consumer goods company to revise the compensation structure to better reflect company performance and prioritise product safety. This could involve tying a higher proportion of variable pay to achieving specific performance goals, including those related to product safety. Implement a dedicated ESG metric explicitly linked to Scope 3 GHG emission reduction progress, with a clear and transparent link to payout levels.",For,No comment available,For ,No comment available,No voting information available,No comments available,For,No comments available,For,No comments available,For,No comment available,For,No comments available,For,No comment available,No voting information available,No comments available,For,No comments available,No voting information available,No comment available,For,No comment available,No voting information available,No comment available,Against,We consider the quantum of the total pay excessive.,For,No comment available,For,No comment available,No voting information available,No comment available,No voting information available,No comment available,For,No comment available,For,No comment available,For,No comment available,No voting information available,No comment available,No voting information available,No comments available,For,No comments available,For,No comment available,For,No comment available,For,No comment available,For,No comment available,For,No comment available,For,No comments available,For,No comment available,No voting information available,No comments available,For,No comments available,For,No comment available,For,No comments available,No voting information available,No comment available,For,No comment available,For,No comments available,For,No comments available,For,No comments available,For,No comment available,"For, Against",Split vote-No comments available,For,No comments available,For,No comments available,Against,We have concerns with maximum awards under the LTIP continuing to be indexed to a number of shares as opposed to a multiple of base salary.

Schroders Plc,Approve Remuneration Report,Against,"We have been unsupportive of the company's Remuneration Policy, and consequently its Remuneration Report, in recent years. Our concerns relate to the absence of a specific cap on the annual bonus scheme. While in 2020 the company introduced an overall cap on total remuneration at time of grant for the CEO (9m sterling pounds) and CFO (4.5m sterling pounds), the bonus does not have an underlying limit which we expect to see. There is a limit on the Long-Term Incentive, of 4x salary, however awards in practice have been far lower - at 1.2x and 1x. Therefore the bonus potential, taking account of the total remuneration cap, is significant when considering the executive salary and LTI grant level. We do note that executives have not received salary increases, the bonus outcome was reduced by 250k sterling pounds to reflect shareholder experience and there was no LTI vesting in FY23 due to the waiving of awards during the pandemic in 2020.

There is a limit on the Long-Term Incentive, of 4x salary, however awards in practice have been far lower  at 1.2x and 1x.
