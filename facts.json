  "extraction_notes": "Financial year is 2024 per multiple references to the year ended 31 December 2024. Currency set to EUR as remuneration amounts are denominated in euros (e.g., \u20ac540,000 salary). Dilution policy limit set to 5 based on LTIP limit of up to 5% of issued share capital; no actual dilution figures disclosed, so total/ltip/stip dilution are null. CEO LTIP max % of salary computed as (\u20ac6,000,000 face value at full vesting for CEO) / (\u20ac540,000 base salary) * 100 = 1111.11%; using explicit figures provided. Post-cessation holding is 2 years and shareholding requirement is 3x salary per explicit policy. No target or maximum short-term bonus percentages disclosed; moreover, no short-term incentive proposed and no 2024 bonus awarded, so bonus % fields are null. CEO/workforce salary increase percentages are not disclosed. Malus and clawback provisions explicitly exist (apply up to two years post vesting/payment). ESG metrics are present in LTIP performance conditions (TSR, financial, and non-financial metrics including SBTi targets and women representation). Being conservative, did not derive any overall dilution from option counts since full issuance scope not provided.",
