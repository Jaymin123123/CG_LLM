Workforce salary increase uses the comparator employee group salary/fees 2023/24 % change of 28%. Bonus policy states target 75% and usual max 150% of salary; exceptional max up to 200% noted but not used for the standard max. LTIP max for CEO is 200% of salary; exceptional up to 400% noted but not used. Post-cessation holding requirement inferred as 2 years from 'tapering to zero over a two-year period'. Shareholding requirement for CEO is described relative to 'normal annual LTIP opportunity' without a numeric percentage, so set to null. No dilution figures or policy headroom were provided in the excerpt, so dilution fields are null. ESG metrics are explicitly referenced as possible components of both bonus and LTIP.",
